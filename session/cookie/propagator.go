// PropagatorOptions is a functional option type for configuring instances of Propagator.
// The type defines a function signature that accepts a pointer to Propagator as its sole argument.
// Functional options are a pattern used to simplify and make more readable the configuration of objects.
// Instead of constructors with many parameters, functional options allow for more flexible and
// composable configurations. A client can pass zero or more of these functions to configure a
// Propagator as needed when creating or updating it.
//
// Examples of such functions might include options that set internal timeout values, specify header names
// for propagation, or configure other internal settings of a Propagator object.
//
// Usage:
// To use PropagatorOptions, define functions that match the signature of this type.
// When such a function is called with a Propagator instance, it should modify the Propagatorâ€™s state
// according to the intended configuration. These functions can then be passed to a constructor function
// or method responsible for setting up a new Propagator, where they will be applied in sequence.
//
// Example of a PropagatorOptions function:
//
//	func WithCustomHeader(name string) PropagatorOptions {
//	    return func(p *Propagator) {
//	        p.headerName = name
//	    }
//	}
type PropagatorOptions func(p *Propagator)

// Propagator is a configuration struct used for managing the settings of an HTTP cookie.
// It provides a structured way to specify the name of a cookie and to define custom behaviors for it
// via a functional option. This can be particularly useful when creating middlewares or handlers
// in web applications where controlled manipulation of cookies is necessary.
//
// Fields:
//
//   - cookieName: This is the identifier for the cookie that the Propagator will manage.
//     It is the key used when setting and retrieving the cookie from an HTTP request or response.
//     The name should be chosen to avoid conflicts with other cookies and should be descriptive
//     of the cookie's purpose.
//
//   - cookieOption: This function allows for customization of the http.Cookie object. It can
//     be used to apply a range of configurations such as setting the path, domain, secure flag,
//     HTTP-only flag, expiration, and any other applicable cookie attributes. By passing a function
//     that takes a pointer to a http.Cookie, the Propagator allows for direct modification of the
//     cookie's properties, enabling more flexible and comprehensive control over cookie behavior.
//
// The Propagator struct thus provides a centralized mechanism to define and manage how a
// cookie is handled in web application scenarios. Its flexibility makes it suitable to fit
// varied requirements and helps in keeping the cookie-related code clean and maintainable.
//
// To use Propagator, the developer can instantiate it with the desired cookie name and a custom
// configuration function. This function will be applied each time the Propagator is called upon
// to manipulate a http.Cookie instance, ensuring that all such cookies adhere to the defined settings.
//
// Example:
// // createSecureCookieOption returns a configuration function that sets the Secure
// // and HttpOnly attributes on a http.Cookie, helping to protect the cookie from
// // certain classes of web vulnerabilities.
//
//	func createSecureCookieOption() func(cookie *http.Cookie) {
//	    return func(cookie *http.Cookie) {
//	        // Secure attribute specifies that the cookie should only be transmitted
//	        // over a secure HTTPS connection from the client. When set to true, the
//	        // cookie will not be sent by the client to the server over an unsecure
//	        // connection (HTTP).
//	        cookie.Secure = true
//
//	        // HttpOnly attribute specifies that the cookie is intended to be accessed
//	        // only by HTTP or HTTPS requests. This helps mitigate the threat of
//	        // client-side script accessing the protected cookie (if the browser supports it).
//	        cookie.HttpOnly = true
//	    }
//	}
//
// // With this setup, a developer can create a new Propagator like so:
//
//	securePropagator := Propagator{
//	    cookieName: "session_token",
//	    cookieOption: createSecureCookieOption(),
//	}
//
// The above example showcases how to define a Propagator that will manage a "session_token" cookie,
// ensuring that it is configured to be Secure and HttpOnly compliant for improved security.

	cookieName   string
	cookieOption func(cookie *http.Cookie)

// InitPropagator creates and initializes a new instance of the Propagator struct with a default
// configuration. It sets a common cookie name, 'sessionId', which is typically used for
// identifying user sessions across HTTP requests. The cookieOption is also initialized, however,
// it is provided as an empty function which effectively means no additional cookie configurations
// are applied at initialization time.
//
// This allows for a Propagator to be readily created and used with its basic necessary component,
// the cookie name, already set. Additional cookie attributes can later be defined by providing
// a custom function to cookieOption.
//
// Returns:
// *Propagator: This is a pointer to the newly created Propagator instance, ready for use in handling
//
//	cookies with the pre-set cookie name.

		// Initialize cookieOption with an empty anonymous function. At this point,
		// it doesn't modify the http.Cookie object, but it can be replaced with a
		// function that sets the desired cookie attributes.
		// For example, one might later define and assign a function that sets the
		// Secure flag or modifies the cookie's MaxAge attribute.
		cookieOption: func(cookie *http.Cookie) {
			// This anonymous function is intended to configure a http.Cookie instance.
			// As it's empty, no configurations are applied by default. This can be changed
			// by providing a function that sets the http.Cookie's fields accordingly,
			// such as Secure, MaxAge, Domain, Path, etc.

// WithCookieName is a functional option helper that creates a PropagatorOptions function,
// which sets the cookieName field of a Propagator struct when applied. This is a common design
// pattern in Go for configuring instances with optional parameters in a flexible and clean manner.
// Instead of having a complex constructor or a multitude of setters for each parameter, you can use
// options functions that apply the desired configurations to the struct.
//
// Parameters:
// - name string: The name of the cookie you wish to set for your Propagator
//
// Returns:
//   - PropagatorOptions: A function that can be passed to a Propagator's configuration.
//     When called, it will set the Propagator's cookieName to the
//     specified 'name' parameter.
//
// Example usage:
// p := &Propagator{}
// nameOption := WithCookieName("user_session")
// nameOption(p)
// This will set the cookieName of the Propagator 'p' to "user_session".

//
// Parameters:
//   - opt: This is a function that takes a pointer to a http.Cookie and modifies it. The modifications can include
//     setting the Secure flag, HttpOnly flag, adjusting the MaxAge property, and so on. The function encapsulates
//     the intended behavior on the cookie, and this behavior is applied each time the Propagator deals with
//     setting or altering a cookie.
//
// Returns:
//   - A function conforming to the PropagatorOptions type. When this function is applied to a Propagator instance,
//     it sets the instance's `cookieOption` field to the `opt` function provided.

// Parameters:

//     that no error has been encountered during the injection process. If future
//     implementations include error checks (e.g., response writer validation),

// Remove creates a cookie with the same name as that stored in the Propagator's cookieName field

//
// Parameters:
//   - writer http.ResponseWriter: The HTTP response writer to which the 'expired' cookie

//
// Returns:
//   - error: This function always returns nil as per the current implementation, signifying
//     the operation was successful without any errors. If error handling is added in
//     the future, this could potentially return actual errors if they occur.
//
// Example usage:
// propagator := InitPropagator() // Initializes a new Propagator
// err := propagator.Remove(responseWriter)
//
//	if err != nil {
//	   // handle error
//	}
